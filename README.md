We will use Spring Boot to handle the back-end part and Angular to handle the front-end part, and they will communicate with each other using a REST API.
Then on the back end, we will have a MySQLdatabase.

## Deployment solution:

Our project should include solutions to provide the deployment environment
required to run the web application. Since each client will have his own instance of the
application, resource optimization, greater efficiency and reducing overhead should be taken
into consideration. Portability also should be ensured since it will be possible to deploy the
application easily to multiple different operating systems and hardware platforms.
Centralized management and orchestration for all the deployment environments have to be
provided too. It will simplify the management of all the application instances and,
simultaneously, to make it more efficient.
