We will use Spring Boot to handle the back-end part and Angular to handle the front-end part, and they will communicate with each other using a REST API.
Then on the back end, we will have a database.

## Tools to be used

· STS (Spring Tool Suite) to develop the Spring Boot project.

· MySQL for the database.

· Visual Studio Code to develop the Angular project.

· Server: Tomcat.
